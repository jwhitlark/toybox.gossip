# toybox.clj.gossip

Toybox is my grouping of toy implementation projects.  These projects
are done to make sure I understand the principles involved.  I take
shortcuts on aspects that I don't consider relevant to the topic under
study.

## gossip

This is a simple implementation of a gossip service, in a single
process, using UDP to send msgs, and some scaffolding to see how it
actually works.  There are push, pull, and hybrid implementations
here.
